I am primarily interested in developing methods related to functional data analysis with applications to women's health and skilled movement. The focus of my dissertation work has aimed to estimate a women's menstrual cycle day using cross-sectional biomarker measurements obtained from urine samples. These estimates can be used to account for sources of variation attributable to the menstrual cycle in clinical studies. Additionally, I have developed a method to simultaneous cluster and decompose functional data across repeated trials. This work has been applied to neuroscience research in order to understand the impacts of strokes on skill movement. I have also worked on projects relating to sequential multiple assignment clinical trials (SMARTs), identifying protective factors against suicidal ideation in late-life adults, and investigating the burden of heart failure treatment in low income communities. 


I received a BA in Statistics and Mathematics from University of Michigan in 2019 and expect to receive a PhD in Biostatistics from Columbia University in 2024. My dissertation is advised by [Jeff Goldsmith](https://jeffgoldsmith.com/). In 2020 I founded a Statistics in the Community ([STATCOM](https://cu-biostats-statcom.github.io/)) chapter at Columbia which provides free statistical consulting to non-profit and government organizations. I am an active member in Columbia's functional data analysis working group (FDAWG) and
